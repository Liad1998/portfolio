                <strong>Average Calculator and Cleaning Service Website</strong> - <img src="C:\Users\liad4\OneDrive\שולחן העבודה\portfolio\MyImage.png" alt="Cleaning service Project">
                The website built on html,css,js,node js,mongo db. Every HTML page is showing the specific option you are going through the service that you want for example if you are now in index-house2.html so you are picking the clean house option for 2 hours. Every html page was designed by the same css file so that the website will be unique. Now lets talk about the funcionality: There is two files of javascript one talks about the service companies that translate from json file to html so we showes them on Show_DB.html page and the other one talks about the server that we run of node js and the communication between the js file to the DB. Every function on the server.js is about query on the DB or selecting from the DB. There are two option - LOGIN and REGISTRY(form.html for example) LOGIN - is talk about verify the username and password on DB (if it's true so lets enter,if not don't do anything). REGISTRY - is talk about user that want to register to our website so he needs to put username and password(not empty one) and it will creates that on the DB. Now let's talk about testing - I created a file that showed the tests that the system did and the results of them(PP file). Another is the ERD that showes the hierarchical process of the DB(PP file). The final subject is the DB - we used mongo db on our app because it is very comfortable. We use the mongo shell and mongoos to communicate between DB to node js. We use function like get and post to manipulate the DB. That's it hopu you'll enjoy from our Website.

                Project Title:
                Cheetah, Hyena, Jaguar, and Tiger Classification

                Project Abstract:
                In this project, we will build a classification model that can classify and predict the correct animal based on input data – determining if the classification matches the correct animal. To achieve this, we will train and evaluate the model using the dataset at our disposal. We will normalize the data according to RGB values to ensure the dataset is ready for use and to improve accuracy, then load the images into a notebook.

                Project Goal:
                The classification task is to correctly classify the most appropriate animal out of the four animals in my dataset.

                Methodology:
                The dataset contains 900 training images, 100 validation images, and 100 testing images.

                Total features: 2 (Image of 400x400x3 matrix, and its classification).
                Target variable: Image classification.
                Training set size: 3240 images.
                Validation set size: 360 images.
                Test set size: 400 images.
                Number of classes: 4 (binary classification)  classification to the correct animal.
                Performance evaluation: Based on accuracy > 70%.
                Missing data in the dataset: No.
